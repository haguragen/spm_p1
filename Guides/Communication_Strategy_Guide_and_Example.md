# ðŸš€ Communication Plan

## Guide: Documenting the Communication Plan in an Scrum SDLC Context  

This section is not typically documented in Scrum teams for real-time projects, as communication in Agile is informal and adaptive. However, for this student assignment, we require teams to document their communication plan and escalation strategy to ensure accountability, structured collaboration, and awareness of issue resolution mechanisms. This helps students develop essential teamwork and project management skills, which are critical for successfully executing complex projects in a professional setting.

### Why Document a Communication Plan?  
- Agile teams thrive on effective communication for seamless collaboration.  
- While daily stand-ups are common in full-time Agile teams, student project teams can adapt meeting frequency based on availability (Two per week for SWEN90016 Assignment 2).  
- Clearly defining communication strategies helps ensure accountability and structured team interactions.  
- Assigning meeting owners ensures responsibility for each discussion.  
- This section helps students **explicitly document their teamwork responsibilities**, making expectations clear.  

### Why Document a Communication Escalation Strategy?  
- In real-world projects, team issues are expected to be **self-managed**.  
- However, student teams often face difficulties managing teamwork effectively.  
- This section ensures that **students are aware of their escalation mechanisms** before issues become critical.  
- **Escalation Triggers** help the team recognize when a problem has **already occurred** and requires action.  
- **Contingency Plans** ensure that the team has a structured response rather than reacting impulsively.
