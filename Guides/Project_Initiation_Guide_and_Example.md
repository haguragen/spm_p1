# ðŸš€ Project Assumptions & Constraints

## Guide: Documenting Project Assumptions in Scrum  

### Importance of Documenting Project Assumptions  
- Helps align the team on factors that may impact delivery.  
- Assists in setting priorities within the Product Backlog and Sprint Planning.  
- Ensures risks and limitations are considered while estimating effort.  
- Helps stakeholders understand dependencies and potential blockers early.

For SWEN90016, as communicated in your lectures, you execute Scrum in a "controlled manner" where the requirements and the outcomes of each Sprint are given to teams in advance. In this scenario, you can make assumptions as they apply to your entire project. Task re-prioritization may not apply given the controlled execution of Scrum SDLC for Assignment 2.

### Common Constraints in Scrum Projects  
1. **Time Constraints**: Limited sprint duration affects how much work can be delivered.  
2. **Resource Constraints**: Availability of developers, testers, and other stakeholders.  
3. **Technical Constraints**: Dependencies on APIs, third-party tools, or infrastructure readiness.  
4. **Budget Constraints**: Limits on software licenses, cloud resources, or external services.  
5. **Regulatory Constraints**: Compliance requirements that influence development timelines.

You are welcome to document any additonal constraints that you forsee for your Assignment 2 project. Make sure you clearly mention the reasons for the constraint identified.

### 1. Time Constraints  
- **Constraint:** The project must deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within 3 sprints.  
- **Justification:** Ensures core functionalities (vehicle detection, slot booking) are available for early testing and stakeholder feedback.

Similarly, you can argue for and document other applicable constraints that apply to your Assignment 2 case study.
