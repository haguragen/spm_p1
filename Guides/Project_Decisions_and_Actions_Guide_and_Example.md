# 🚀 Project Decisions & Action Lists 

Decisions made during the project execution with stakeholders outside the Scrum team can lead to action items, some of which the Scrum team must track and resolve to ensure project alignment and successful execution. While the scope of the SWEN90016 assignment follows a controlled Scrum SDLC process (and would not involve interaction with other stakeholders apart from the teaching team), understanding the role of an action list is still valuable. It highlights how action items can emerge from project activities beyond the Scrum team, ensuring alignment with stakeholder decisions and broader project requirements.

For SWEN90016, teams would not document any Action Lists for the Scrum Team from external stakeholders.
Also for SWEN90016, teams would not be required to document any stakeholder decisions (and action items resulting from these decisions) in general.
However, if the teams were to interact with the client (Teaching Team) during their Sprint Execution or Sprint Outcomes and any significant decisions were to be made during the same, the same could to be documented here.

## 📌 **Overview: Importance of Action Lists in Stakeholder Communication**  

In Scrum projects, effective communication with stakeholders beyond the Scrum team is essential for project success. While the **Product Owner** is the primary liaison, interactions with other important project stakeholders (such as **clients, end users, business stakeholders, legal teams, and project sponsors** (to name a few)) may generate action items that impact development.  

Maintaining an **Action List** serves the following key purposes:  
- **Improves Stakeholder Engagement**: Ensures stakeholder inputs are acknowledged and translated into actionable tasks (if applicable for the Scrum Team).  
- **Facilitates Decision Follow-ups**: Ensures decisions made with other important project stakeholders are acted upon.  

By integrating stakeholder-driven tasks into the **Pending Action Items Table** (should they were to apply as action items for the Scrum Team), teams can systematically track and execute responsibilities beyond the Scrum team, ensuring smooth collaboration across all project stakeholders.

## 🔗 **Integrating Action Items & Stakeholder Decisions**  

1. **Log all stakeholder decisions** in the Stakeholder Decision Log.  
2. **Extract follow-up actions** and add them to the Pending Action Items Table.  
3. **Assign action items** to relevant Scrum team members.  
4. **Track progress** using status updates.
