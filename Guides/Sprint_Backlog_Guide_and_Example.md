# ðŸš€ Sprint Backlog  

## Overview  
A **Sprint Backlog** is a subset of the Product Backlog that contains user stories selected for a sprint. It includes detailed tasks, owners, effort estimates, and daily tracking to monitor progress toward the sprint goal.

### **Key Elements of a Sprint Backlog**
- **User Story ID (US#):** Cross-links to the User Story ID in the Product Backlog for traceability.  
- **User Story:** A structured feature description selected for the sprint.  
- **Tasks:** Subtasks needed to complete the user story. Each task has a unique ID (e.g., `US1_T1`).  
- **Owner:** Team member responsible for completing the task.  
- **Status:** Task progress (e.g., *Not Started, In Progress, Completed*).  
- **Estimated Effort (SP):** Total story points assigned to the user story.  
- **Daily Progress Tracking (Day 1 - Day 14):** The remaining effort for the user story as tasks are completed.

## **Example: Sprint Backlog for Smart Parking System (Sprint 1)**  

| User Story ID | User Story | Task ID | Task Description | Owner | Status | Est. Effort (SP) | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5 | Day 6 | Day 7 | Day 8 | Day 9 | Day 10 | Day 11 | Day 12 | Day 13 | Day 14 |
|--------------|-----------|---------|------------------|-------|--------|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| US1 | As a driver, I want to search for and book a parking spot in advance, so that I can be assured of a space before I arrive. | US1_T1 | Develop UI for searching available parking spots | Alice | In Progress | 13 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | US1_T2 | Integrate real-time parking availability API | Bob | Not Started |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | US1_T3 | Implement booking confirmation & email notifications | Charlie | Not Started |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Note:** The effort burns down collectively per **user story** across the sprint, ensuring all related tasks are completed before the story reaches complete.

## **Guidelines for Updating the Sprint Backlog**
1. **Effort Burn-Down:** Story points **burn down collectively** per user story.
2. **Tracking Progress:** The burn-down chart should reflect decreasing effort over time.
3. **Definition of Done:** A user story is only complete when all tasks meet the **Definition of Done (DoD)**.

## **Final Notes**
- Keep updates consistent for accurate tracking.
- Ensure dependencies are managed to avoid bottlenecks.
- The **burn-down chart should reflect actual progress** and guide sprint planning.
