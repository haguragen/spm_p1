# ðŸš€ Risk Monitoring in Scrum

In real-world Scrum projects, teams manage risks dynamically through collaboration and iterative improvements. However, for the SWEN90016 assignment, students must document how identified risks are monitored and managed throughout Sprint 1. This helps reinforce the importance of proactive risk management in software projects.

### **Guide: Monitoring Risks During Sprints**
To ensure risks are actively managed, teams should integrate risk monitoring into existing Scrum ceremonies:

- **Sprint Planning:** Identify key risks that need attention and allocate mitigation tasks.
- **Daily Stand-Ups:** Assess whether any risks have materialized and review ongoing mitigation efforts.
- **Sprint Reviews:** Evaluate whether risks impacted sprint deliverables and note lessons learned.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflect on risk-handling effectiveness and improve future mitigation strategies.

### **Using Risk Stories in the Sprint Backlog**
If a risk has a high likelihood of occurring and requires active mitigation within a sprint, teams can document it as a **risk story** in the Sprint Backlog. A risk story follows the same structure as a user story but focuses on preventing or mitigating a risk.

## **Example: Risk Monitoring for Sprint 1 (Smart Parking System)**

### **1. Risk Monitoring Approach**
| Scrum Ceremony         | Risk Monitoring Strategy |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Sprint Planning**   | Identify high-priority risks and create risk stories if necessary. |
| **Daily Stand-Ups**   | Discuss if any risks have materialized and assess ongoing mitigation efforts. |
| **Sprint Reviews**    | Evaluate whether any risks impacted sprint deliverables and document learnings. |
| **Sprint Retrospective** | Reflect on risk-handling effectiveness and improve mitigation strategies. |

### **2. Risk Story in Sprint Backlog**
**Risk:** Delayed access to the real-time parking data API could impact system integration.

#### **Risk Story Format:**
As a development team, we want to create a mock API for real-time parking data so that we can continue development without delays from external dependencies.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- A mock API should simulate real-time parking data updates.
- The system should be able to switch between the mock API and the real API when available.

#### **Backlog Details:**
| Field            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Priority**    | High |
| **Estimation**  | 3 Story Points |
| **Owner**       | Backend Developer |
| **Dependencies** | API documentation from third-party provider |
| **Notes**       | The mock API should be easy to disable once the real API is available. |

By incorporating risk monitoring into Scrum ceremonies and using risk stories in the Sprint Backlog, teams can ensure that risks are proactively managed throughout the project.
