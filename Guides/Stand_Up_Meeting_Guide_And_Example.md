# 🚀 Daily Stand-up Meeting

This document tracks daily stand-up meetings. Each team member shares updates on their progress, blockers, next steps, and assigned action items.
While stand-up meetings occur daily in industry projects, in SWEN90016 considering students have multiple subject commitments, we consider that you have only 1/4th of your ETFSL (Estimated Full Time Student Load) available for this subject (assuming full time students would generally take about 4 subjects per semester). Therefore, it is acceptable if your teams can do TWO STAND-UP MEETINGS EVERY WEEK. The standard terminology is "Daily Stand Ups", but for SWEN90016, you can consider the same as "Stand Up" meetings executed twice a week.

During daily standups, a recurring issue may arise where tasks and user stories previously committed for delivery experience repeated delays. For instance, a user story expected to be completed on Monday may continue to be reported as delayed in subsequent standup meetings throughout the week. Such slippages can negatively impact sprint outcomes, requiring potential reprioritization of sprint goals and leading to project delays. This should be closely monitored and proactively addressed it at the earliest opportunity to mitigate its impact.

## 🏆 **Stand-up Meeting Format**
Each participant answers these four key questions:

1️⃣ **What did I do yesterday?**  
2️⃣ **What will I do today?**  
3️⃣ **Do I have any blockers?**  
4️⃣ **What are my next steps? (Action Items)**  

- Ensure all team members are available and aware of the stand-up timing.  
- Have the Sprint Backlog and Issue Tracking system open.  
- Designate a timekeeper to keep the meeting within 30 minutes.  
- Ensure meetings happen at the same time at-least twice a week.  
- Maintain a log of each stand-up in the repository.  
- Use a structured format to document updates, blockers, and action items.  
- Ensure blockers are assigned for resolution.  
- Confirm next steps for the team.  
- Keep discussions on track and avoid problem-solving within the stand-up.
