- **High 🟠**: A significant defect that affects core functionality but can be worked around temporarily, requiring a quick fix.
- **Medium 🟡**: A moderate defect that impacts non-critical functionality and may be deferred without immediate consequences.
- **Low 🟢**: A minor defect that has little to no impact on functionality, typically cosmetic or related to user interface improvements.

## 📌 **Defect Log Best Practices**

- **Immediate Documentation**: Report defects as soon as they are identified to maintain accurate records.
- **Clear Severity Levels**: Ensure defects are classified based on their impact on the system (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **Timely Resolution**: Assign defects to the responsible developers and monitor their resolution status closely.
- **Testing and Verification**: Ensure all fixes are tested before being marked as resolved. Document test results to ensure fixes meet the required standards.

This log will ensure that defects are tracked properly and resolved in a structured manner, improving the overall quality of the project. 🚀
