## Project Constraints  
### 1. Time Constraints  
- **Constraint:** 6-week development cycle, approximately 100-150 hours of work
- **Justification:** This project was a student group assignment in the SWEN90016 course, and the course schedule dictated the development cycle. Students had other academic commitments and could only devote limited time to the project. 
### 2. Resource Constraints  
- **Constraint:** Limited human resources and hardware resources.
- **Justification:** Projects are undertaken by teams of students on the course, with a fixed number of students per team (usually 3-5), along with other course commitments, limiting overall development capacity.Servers, storage and network resources are configured by the university (WordPress hosting) and cannot be expanded or replaced with third-party hosting services.
### 3. Technical Constraints  
- **Constraint:** The platform for technology must use the school's pre-installed WordPress and plug-ins.
- **Justification:** In order to reduce the difficulty of technical setup and server maintenance costs, the school IT has pre-configured the WordPress environment. Students do not need to deal with deployment, security and other issues.
### 4. Budget Constraints  
- **Constraint:** There's no additional financial support, open source or school resources must be used.
- **Justification:** This is a teaching project with no specific funding. All tools and data are free or provided by the school.
### 5. Regulatory Constraints  
- **Constraint:** Data must comply with privacy regulations.
- **Justification:** Even if the project is deployed only in an instructional context, it must adhere to the university's norms for handling private student and staff data and must not collect or disclose sensitive information. Projects may only use public datasets provided by City of Melbourne and may not access third-party services that require authentication or are copyrighted.
