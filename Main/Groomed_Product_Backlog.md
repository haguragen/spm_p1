# Groomed Product Backlog - Assignment 2

| User Story ID | Use Case | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Priority | Estimation (SP) | User Story Description | Dependencies | Notes |
|--|----------|-----------|---------------------|----------|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|-------|
| US1 |View Tree Map |As a PhD student, I want to view tree distribution on an interactive map so that I can find suitable outdoor spots for gatherings. | Given I open the platform, when I access the map, then I should see Melbourne's tree coverage with zoom and pan support. | Must-have | 13 | Displays tree data from the city dataset on a visual, interactive map using mapping tools. | Tree dataset, Map API | Recommended to use Leaflet or Google Maps. Ensure performance with large data. |
| US2 |2 Factor Authentication |As a new user, I want to register and log in securely, so that I need a more safe way to login.| Users could and must use TOTP pattern to login their account. | Must-have | 5 |Add tool to complete 2 factor authentication| Depends on US1 | Should support some apps to help users to login.|
| US3 |Filter Tree Info |As a PhD student, I want to filter trees by species, age, and location so that I can choose a preferred environment.| Given a set of filtering options, when I apply a filter (e.g., tree species), then the map should update to show relevant results only.| Must-have | 5 |Provides multi-condition filters for species, age, location, and life expectancy.| Depends on US1 | Should support multi-select filters; test for performance with large datasets.|
| US4 | Add Recommendation | As a PhD student, I want to mark and comment on recommended locations so that others can benefit from my experience.| Given a location on the map, when I click to recommend it and add a note, then it should be saved and visible to others.| Must-have | 21 | Adds ability to pin locations with comments and tag as "recommended spots".| Requires interactive map from US1 | Needs basic user identification (e.g., WordPress login).|
| US5 | View Recommendations | As a PhD student, I want to browse previous recommendations so that I can select suitable meeting places.| Given there are existing recommended spots, when I browse the map, then I should see pins with notes and ratings..| Should-have | 5 | Displays user-submitted recommendations with optional filters..| Depends on US4 | Pagination or clustering may be used to manage dense map data.|
| US6 | Quick Location Search | As a supervisor, I want to quickly find densely shaded areas so that I can plan informal gatherings effectively.| Given advanced search options, when I enter relevant terms (e.g., "dense tree cover"), then the system should suggest matching spots.| Must-have | 5 | Adds keyword or density-based ranking to location selection.| Needs structured tree data and index | Can reuse filtering logic from US02.|
| US7 | Add Event Feedback | As a supervisor, I want to record feedback for past gatherings so that I can improve future venue choices.| Given a previously used location, when I add a comment or rating, then it should be saved and viewable later. |Should-have | 5 | Allows adding structured feedback to previously selected locations. | Depends on US4 | Could use simple rating system and predefined tags. |
| US8 | Input Validation | As a teaching team member, I want form inputs to be validated so that users have a smoother experience and avoid errors.| Given a form, when I enter invalid data (e.g., empty fields), then I should see appropriate validation messages.| Could-have | 3 | Adds front-end validation for forms (e.g., required fields, correct format).| Depends on relevant forms being developed | Can utilize HTML5 validation and WordPress plugins.|
| US9 | Ensure Reusability | As a course coordinator, I want the platform to be reusable for future student projects so that it has long-term value.| Given clear documentation and modular code, when future students access the project, then they should be able to reuse and extend it.| Should-have | 5 | Emphasizes maintainability, clean architecture, and documentation.| None | Encourage modular code structure, readable components, and inline comments.|
| US10 | Platform Compatibility | As a university IT team member, I want the platform to run within the WordPress environment so that it remains compatible with existing infrastructure.| Given the university hosting environment, when the platform is deployed, then it should work without server or plugin conflicts.| Must-have | 3 | Ensures compatibility with WordPress stack and plugins.| Hosting provided by university | Avoid use of custom servers or third-party plugins outside university IT approval.|
| US11 | Maintain System | As a future student developer, I want to understand and extend the system easily so that I can contribute to its evolution.| Given good documentation and structured code, when I explore the repository, then I should be able to implement new features.| Should-have | 3 | Encourages developer-focused practices such as README, comments, and simple onboarding.| None| Should include deployment instructions and module-level documentation.|
