### User Story 3: 	Add Recommendation
As a PhD student, I want to mark and comment on recommended locations so that others can benefit from my experience.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- User could mark and comment on a location.
- Other users should be able to see those marked and commented locations.
- Hate, political, scam and other speeches which are not suitable to display should be blocked.

### Estimation using Fibonacci Sequence
| Factor              | Consideration |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Complexity         | Severe - Need to build a database to record the marks and comments and a new interface to display them need to be created.|
| Uncertainty        | High - Our developers are unfamiliar to the combination of front-end and back-end.|
| Dependencies      | Moderate - Need to use database tools. |
| Risk              | Severe - Database security and comments need to be checked. |
| Estimated Story Points | **21** |
